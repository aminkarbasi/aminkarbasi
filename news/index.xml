Adviserr: Daniel Spielman and Amin Karbasi
Abstract: Randomized experiments are the gold standard for investigating the causal effect of treatment on a population. In this dissertation, we present algorithmic advances for three different problems arising in the design and analysis of randomized experiments: covariate balancing, variance estimation, and bipartite experiments. In the first chapter, we describe an inherent trade-off between covariate balancing and robustness, which we formulate as a distributional discrepancy problem.</description>

Adviserr: Amin Karbasi
Abstract: As a projection-free algorithm, Frank-Wolfe (FW) method, also known as conditional gradient, has recently received considerable attention in the machine learning community. In this dissertation1, we study several topics on the FW variants for scalable projection-free optimization. We first propose 1-SFW, the first projection-free method that requires only one sample per iteration to update the optimization variable and yet achieves the best known complexity bounds for convex, non-convex, and monotone DR-submodular settings.</description>

ABSTRACT: The difficulty of searching through a massive amount of data in order to quickly make an informed decision is one of today&amp;rsquo;s most ubiquitous challenges. Many scientific and engineering models feature data with inherently discrete characteristics, where discrete means that the data takes on a finite set of possible values. Examples of such data include phrases in text to objects in an image.</description>

Combining neuroscience with algorithms and network science, Yale researchers have developed a method of analyzing the neuronal connections of individual brains that allow them to successfully predict the subjects’ IQs, their sex, and even tasks they were performing at the time of the brain scan.
In a collaboration between the labs of Amin Karbasi, assistant professor of electrical engineering &amp;amp; computer science and Todd Constable, professor of radiology and biomedical imaging and of neurosurgery, the researchers analyzed the functional MRI scans of more than 100 subjects from the Human Connectome Project, a five-year effort to create a network map of the human brain.</description>

      <description>ISIT 2018 Tutorial on Submodularity in Information and Data Science.
Submodularity is a structural property over functions that has received significant attention in the mathematics community, owing to their natural and wide ranging applicability. In particular, numerous challenging problems in information theory, machine learning, and artificial intelligence rely on optimization techniques for which submodularity is key to solving them efficiently.We will start by defining submodularity and polymatroidality — we will survey a surprisingly diverse set of functions that are submodular and operations that preserve submodularity.</description>

      <description>CVPR 2018 tutorial on Big Data Summarization: Algorithms and Applications.
The increasing amounts of data in computer vision requires robust tools to extract most important information from large collections of data. The summarization problem addresses this challenge by finding a small subset of most informative data points from large datasets. However, summarization often leads to optimization programs that are nonconvex and NP-hard. While (non)convex programming and submodular optimization have been studied intensively in mathematics, successful and effective applications of them for the problem of information summarization along with new theoretical results have recently emerged.</description>

      <description>We are organizing a workshop at NIPS 2017 on Discrete Structures in Machine Learning.
Abstract: Traditionally, machine learning has been focused on methods where objects reside in continuous domains. The goal of this workshop is to advance state-of-the-art methods in machine learning that involve discrete structures.
Models with ultimately discrete solutions play an important role in machine learning. At its core, statistical machine learning is concerned with making inferences from data, and when the underlying variables of the data are discrete, both the tasks of model inference as well as predictions using the inferred model are inherently discrete algorithmic problems.</description>

T​he goal of this program is to grow the reach and impact of CS theory within machine learning.
One central component of the program will be ​formalizing basic questions in developing areas of practice​, and gaining fundamental insights into these. Target areas of particular interest are ​interactive learning​ and representation learning. Interactive learning consists of scenarios in which the communication between human and learner is richer than a one-­way transmission of labeled examples; this happens, for instance, in teaching, or explanation-based learning, and in crowdsourcing.</description>

      <description>Grainger Award 2017 from National Academy of Engineering for Advancement of Interdisciplinary Research.
Amin Karbasi (Yale University) and Amit Surana (United Technologies Research Center) have received a Grainger Grant to “develop a unified approach for saliency detection in heterogeneous temporal data.” The grant will support the team’s interdisciplinary research to develop algorithms for compressing massive amounts of time—varying data into small salient or informative datasets to allow faster decision making. For example, if salient or significant images in particular frames can be identified from terabytes of video stream, the original video can be summarized using a much smaller set of frames, enabling much faster video processing for surveillance applications such as anomaly detection and activity classification.</description>
