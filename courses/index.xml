      <description>Course ID: EENG 433 The study of fundamental techniques in discrete optimization and its numerous industry applications, including airline scheduling, telecommunication routing, recommender systems, and predicting financial markets. Topics include linear programs, dynamic programs, finite and infinite state scenarios, bandit optimization, and potentially submodular functions and relationships between discrete and continuous optimization methods through the lens of submodularity. Familiarity with discrete mathematics, algorithms, combinatorics, and calculus is assumed.

      <description>Course ID: ENAS 962 This is an interdisciplinary course with a focus on the emerging science of complex networks and their mathematical models. Students learn about the recent research on the structure and analysis of such networks, and on models that abstract their basic properties. Topics include random graphs and their properties, probabilistic techniques for link analysis, centralized and decentralized search algorithms, random walks, diffusion and epidemic processes, and spectral methods.</description>
